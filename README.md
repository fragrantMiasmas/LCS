# Longest Common Substring Algorithm
----------
##Notes
To run the full benchmark, java's stack size needs to be increased.
To do this in netbeans, select `Run > Set Project Configuration > Configure...`
and add `-Xss4g` to the `VM Options` field

Otherwise, the program will halt with a stack overflow when attempting the last benchmark.
